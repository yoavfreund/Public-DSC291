## HW1

There are two parts to this HW, The HW is due before class on on Tuesday April 7 For the first part. Each team should submit one explanation. The second part is to get you acquainted with jupyter conda and AWS. There is nothing to submit. What you practice here will be the basis for what you do later on. Ask your team-mates for help if you get stuck. 

### Writing a short explanation

Each team is to write an explanation of at most 300 words. **Important** the goal is get somebody that does not know the concept to understand it, not for you to demonstrate that **you** know the subject. Minimize the use of Jargon, and explain all jargon that you use.

You are encouraged to read the explanations other people wrote and my comments to those explanation. (A link was shared in class). You might also benefit from reading entries in wikipedia or other sources.

Your strength is in the diversity of your group. Everybody should read and comment on each version until you all think it is good. Your goal is that everybody in your group and in the class would understand the concept. 

* Team 1: The Internet, and the Internet Protocol. Give the history and the reasons for it's popularity.
* Team 2: What is Object oriented programming and what are it's main advantages over Procedure Oriented Programming?
* Team 3: Recursive definitions what are they, and why are they useful?
* Team 4: Chaotic Behaviour. What is it? Give 2 examples of chaotic behaviour.
* Team 5: Map Reduce is a programming abstraction. Explain without reference to computer hardware or parallelism.

### Getting started with AWS

Follow the directions in gettingstarted.md and do the following (ask the help of teammates first, then TAs and other students).  Here are the tasks I would like you to achieve.

1. clone the class github repository on your computer.
1. Run the first jupyter notebook on your laptop.
1. Get the AWS credentials from your team's treasurer. and configure your credentials. **Never use email or text to share credentials**, **The only safe way to share credentials is through a google file which the treasurer shares ONLY with the members of the class**
2. use AWS CLI to create a bucket on S3 and copy a file into it.
4. run aws-jupyter to create an instance.
5. Run the first jupyter notebook on that instance.
